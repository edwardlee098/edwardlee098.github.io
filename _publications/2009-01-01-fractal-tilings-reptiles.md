This research explores the construction methods for fractal tilings and fractal reptiles, providing systematic approaches to generate complex geometric patterns with self-similar properties. The work contributes to both theoretical understanding and practical applications of fractal geometry.

The paper offers valuable insights for researchers in mathematics, computer graphics, and pattern design, presenting algorithmic approaches that can be implemented computationally to create sophisticated fractal structures.

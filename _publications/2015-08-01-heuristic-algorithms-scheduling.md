This research focuses on solving complex scheduling problems that consider learning effects at both job and machine levels. The study employs heuristic algorithms to optimize scheduling decisions in manufacturing environments where performance improves over time due to learning effects.

The paper contributes to the field of intelligent manufacturing by providing practical solutions for scheduling optimization in dynamic production environments.

This research investigates single-machine scheduling problems where both learning and forgetting effects influence job processing times. The study provides mathematical models and solution approaches for realistic manufacturing scenarios where worker performance improves with experience (learning) but may deteriorate due to breaks or time gaps (forgetting).

The paper contributes to scheduling theory by developing comprehensive models that capture the dual nature of human performance in production environments, leading to more accurate and practical scheduling solutions.

This research addresses the challenging problem of parallel-machine scheduling under uncertainty, where processing times are represented as fuzzy numbers and learning effects are considered. The objective is to minimize the makespan in a production environment characterized by imprecise information.

The study contributes to fuzzy optimization and scheduling theory by providing effective algorithms for real-world manufacturing scenarios where exact processing times cannot be determined precisely.
